📝 Text Summarizer – Web Application

📌 Overview

The Text Summarizer Web Application is an intuitive and efficient tool developed using Python and Streamlit that aims to transform the way users interact with lengthy textual content. With just a few clicks, users can generate concise, coherent, and meaningful summaries from large blocks of text, enabling faster information consumption and enhanced comprehension. Whether for academic research, news reading, or business documentation, this application simplifies information overload through automated summarization.

---> Key Features

Custom Length Summaries: Users can choose the desired length of the summary (short, medium, long) based on their needs.

Bullet Point Summaries: Summarized outputs are neatly presented in bullet points for better readability and clarity.

Topic-Based Summarization: Users can input specific topics or keywords, and the app intelligently highlights and summarizes text related to those topics.

85% Efficiency: Achieved a high accuracy rate in generating relevant and meaningful summaries, tested against real-world datasets and documents.

Streamlit UI: Built with a sleek and responsive interface using Streamlit, allowing real-time interaction and instant results.
